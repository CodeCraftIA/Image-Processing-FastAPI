# Image Processing Web Application

## INTRO  

### Image Processing Web Application  

Welcome to the Image Processing Web Application! This project aims to provide a platform for users to upload images and perform various processing tasks. The application includes functionalities such as image segmentation, face detection, background removal, contour detection, and image classification using a deep learning model. By utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, users can gain insights into their images and visualize the results in a beautiful and intuitive interface.  

### Objectives  
The primary objectives of this project include:  

- **Image Upload**: Allow users to upload images in supported formats (.jpg, .png, .jpeg, .gif) for processing.  
- **Image Processing**: Implement features for segmentation, face detection, background removal, and contour detection using OpenCV.  
- **Image Classification**: Use a pre-trained MobileNet model to classify images and provide the top 3 predictions.  
- **User Experience**: Enhance user interaction with loading animations and visual feedback during the processing of images.  

### Technologies Used  
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python. üöÄ  
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks. üñºÔ∏è  
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations on image data. üî¢  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing the MobileNet model for image classification. üìä  
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the user interface. üé®
